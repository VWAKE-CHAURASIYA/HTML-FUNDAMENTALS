    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>Html stand for hypertext Markup language.
        where Hypertext is the text which contains links to the text.
        Markup language means it is a way which gives the instruction to a computer about how the content should 
        be organised and displayed.
    </p>
    <p><b>History of HTML:</b>The concept of hyperlink was introduced in 1960's by Ted Nelson, and after 20 years www introduced by tim berners lee, who has also created the first website.</p>
    <p>currently we are usign html of verrsion 5, which means html5, which contains some additonal tag like sementic tags which contains video , audio tags and many useful tags.</p>

    <h2>HTML SYNTAX</h2>
    <p>element: combination of opening tags and content and closing tag are called as element.</p>
    <p>tags: are basically used to speciffy the funciton which we want to use.</p>
    <p>we have to write our codes in any IDE(let say vS code), for using html file we use .htm extension.
        earlier when we use ms-docs there will be a rule to use only three letters as its extension.
    </p>
    <p>we have to always use index.html as our homepage, which is default.</p>
    <h2>HTML ATTRIBUTES</h2>
    <p>attributes are used along with html tags which defines the characterstics of an elememt.</p>
    <p>attributes provides additional informaion about the elements.</p>
    <p><b>Note:Html tag is case-insenstive </b>we can install (auto close tag) in vs code extension to use fastly.</p>

    <h2>HTML HEADING</h2>
    <p>there are 6 ways through which we can represent heading.</p>
    <p>heading tag are used to speciffy heading.</p>
    <p>h1 is considered as larger heading. it sizes are typecally 24px to 36px</p>
    <p><b>Note:we have to focurs on write h1 heading atleast once in our webpage.</b></p>
    <p><b>we have to follow to write the heading sequentially with proper heraichaal manner.</b></p>
    <p>heading are displayed from h1 to h6, where h1 is larger heading and h6 is smaller heading.</p>

    <h2>HTML PARAGRAPH</h2>
    <p>paragrap tag is used to write paragraph in our webpage.browser automaticaly add a single blank line before and after p tag.</p>
    <b><p>Note: we can't able to nest any ohter tag inside p tag.As p tag is a block level element(we can do by using inline element)</p></b>

    <h2>SELF-CLOSING TAGS</h2>
    <p>these are the tages which don't have their own content.</p>
    <p>eg. are link image, break, horizontal line tags.</p>
    <h2>TEXT-FORMATING</h2>
    <p>➡️for bold and italic: we use <strong>strong</strong>and <em>em</em></p>
    <p>➡️for underline and strikethrough we use <u>u</u> and <s>strikethrough(s)</s></p>
    <p>➡️for subscript and superscript we use sub and sup tags eg. H<sub>2</sub>O  and  MC<sup>2</sup>.</p>
    <p>➡️for preformatted webpage (according to our desire space) we use pre tag.
          <pre>for eg:
